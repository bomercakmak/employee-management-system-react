```

### Local Storage

```
The Web Storage API is a set of mechanisms that enable browsers to store key/value pairs.The key/value pairs represent storage objects, which are similar to objects except they remain intact during page loads, and are always strings. As a result, you can use the Employee Management System on your browser without any loss of information.
```
